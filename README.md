SQL Pizza Sales Project
This repository contains SQL scripts and queries that analyze pizza sales data from a fictional pizza restaurant. The project provides a set of queries for analyzing key business metrics and generating valuable insights from the sales data.

Project Overview
This project demonstrates the ability to manipulate and query sales data using SQL. It includes tasks ranging from basic metrics to advanced analytical queries that track the performance of different pizzas and customer ordering behavior. The dataset contains details of orders, pizzas, customers, and revenue, enabling a variety of analyses to be performed.

SQL Queries and Results
The project is divided into three sections based on the complexity of the queries:

Basic SQL Queries:
Total Number of Orders Placed:
Query to count the total number of customer orders placed in the database.

Total Revenue Generated from Pizza Sales:
A query that calculates the total revenue based on pizza sales.

Highest-Priced Pizza:
Identifies the pizza with the highest price in the menu.

Most Common Pizza Size Ordered:
Identifies which pizza size (small, medium, large) is ordered most frequently.

Top 5 Most Ordered Pizza Types and Quantities:
Lists the top 5 pizza types ordered along with the quantities sold.

Intermediate SQL Queries:

Total Quantity of Each Pizza Category Ordered:
Uses JOIN operations to calculate the total quantity of pizzas ordered in each category (e.g., vegetarian, non-vegetarian).

Distribution of Orders by Hour of the Day:
Retrieves the distribution of orders based on the time of day (e.g., how many orders were placed between 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM).

Category-Wise Distribution of Pizzas:
Joins relevant tables to determine how many pizzas from each category (e.g., vegetarian, non-vegetarian) were sold.

Average Number of Pizzas Ordered Per Day:
Groups orders by date and calculates the average number of pizzas ordered per day.

Top 3 Most Ordered Pizza Types Based on Revenue:
Determines the top 3 pizza types that have generated the most revenue.

Advanced SQL Queries:

Percentage Contribution of Each Pizza Type to Total Revenue:
Calculates the percentage of total revenue contributed by each pizza type.

Cumulative Revenue Generated Over Time:
Analyzes and visualizes the cumulative revenue generated over a specified time period.

Top 3 Most Ordered Pizza Types Based on Revenue for Each Pizza Category:
Determines the top 3 pizza types with the highest revenue, broken down by each pizza category.
